## OpenMVVM Framework

OpenMVVM Framework provides **unified API** for MVVM applications **across many platforms**.
Our goal is to cover all commonly used platforms and allow developers to use the same set of page viewmodels, classes and services everywhere.
Just use OpenMVVM base classes, contracts and appropriate implementation for desired platform and go cross-platform!

## OpenMVVM.WebView Project

OpenMVVM.WebView is open-source project based on OpenMVVM Framework that **brings HTML/CSS UI technology to C# based MVVM applications**.
Write your viewmodels in C# and let web designers create UI for them, using simple binding library.

Platforms supported so far:

* UWP
* iOS
* Android
